to test whether Queue is thradesafe, I modified the Queue class.
        add a new private Integer variable count,
        and in the Queue's add method, make the count plus 1 and force the thread sleep 1 second,
         when the 'head ==null' statement is true.

if the Queue is thradesafe, the value of count must be 1, because the variable head is assigned to a none null value by the first thread,
the second thread, or the third thread, or the following thread will not execute the if statement, and will go the else part directly.

the test set up three threads, but the output is not 1.

so the Queue class is not threadsafe.
