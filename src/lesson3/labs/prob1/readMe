run the main function in the PersonWithJob class, we get the result below:

                p1.equals(p2)? false
                p2.equals(p1)? true

reason:
    p1 is the instance of PersonWithJob which is the subclass of Person, and override the equals method.
    p2 is the instance of Person class.

    when execute the code "p1.equals(p2)", the equals method in the PersonWithJob class is executed.
    because p2 is not the instance of PersonWithJob, the result is false;

    when execute the code "p2.equals(p1)", the equals method in the Person class is executed.
    because Person is the parent of PersonWithJob, and the names are same, the result is true;



composition solution:
    The PersonWithJobComposition class is the composition solution.
